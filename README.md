3D game engine using the raycasting technique. The project involves developing a first-person perspective game similar to early 3D games like Wolfenstein 3D.
Key Objectives:

    Raycasting Engine: Implement a 3D engine that uses raycasting to render a 2D map in 3D space.
    Game Mechanics: Create basic game mechanics including player movement, wall collision detection, and view rotation.
    Graphics: Use graphics and color management to render the game environment and objects.
    Control: Implement controls for player navigation and interaction within the game world.

Deliverables:

    Game Window: A graphical window displaying the game world.
    Rendering: A 3D view of the map based on the raycasting algorithm.
    User Interaction: Ability for the player to move around and look around in the game environment.

The project emphasizes fundamental graphics programming, mathematical concepts related to raycasting, and understanding game engine architecture.
